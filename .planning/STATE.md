# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Multi-operator signature aggregation over P2P must work reliably using commonware instead of libp2p
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Broadcast and Routing

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Broadcast and Routing)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Broadcast Engine integration with two-channel architecture, all P2pCommand handlers, 7 integration tests

Progress: [######....] 63%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 14.2 min
- Total execution time: 1.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 32 min | 10.7 min |
| 02 | 2 | 39 min | 19.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 13m, 12m, 7m, 22m, 17m
- Trend: stable (Phase 2 plans are larger scope)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Single broadcast channel with service-ID filtering (not per-service channels) — commonware channels are static, registered before network.start()
- Commonware Runner on dedicated OS thread with cross-thread channel bridge — cannot nest Tokio runtimes
- Ed25519 for P2P identity via ChaCha20Rng from BIP-39 mnemonic — commonware's native crypto scheme
- Clean break on P2P config format — simpler than compatibility layer for a networking rewrite
- rand_chacha 0.3 (not 0.9) to match commonware-cryptography's rand_core 0.6 — version mismatch causes trait incompatibility
- commonware-math added as direct dependency for Random trait needed by PrivateKey::random()
- Config::local() defaults provide sufficient rate limiting (SEC-02) — no explicit builder calls needed
- Map::from_iter_dedup() for Oracle peer map — handles duplicate keys gracefully
- context.stop(0, None) for clean commonware runtime shutdown on bridge loop exit
- Config::local() for discovery in tests — allow_private_ips=true needed for localhost
- Set::from_iter_dedup for discovery Oracle peer set — handles duplicate keys gracefully
- BlockPeer in both lookup and discovery bridge loops — consistent API regardless of mode
- P2pMessage uses [u8; 32] for service_id_bytes — zero-cost comparison with ServiceId::inner()
- P2pMessage::Read Cfg is (RangeCfg<usize>, ()) — enables ReadRangeExt ergonomic API
- ServiceRouter uses HashSet<[u8; 32]> for O(1) lookup on raw service ID bytes
- RetryQueue bounded at 64 items with oldest-drop eviction (BCAST-04)
- Digestible impl concatenates service_id_bytes + payload before SHA-256 hashing for deterministic dedup digest
- Two-channel broadcast: channel 0 for Engine caching, channel 1 for direct forwarding to Aggregator
- Tokio mpsc bridge task for commonware Receiver -> tokio::select! compatibility
- Encode::encode() returns Bytes (Into<IoBufs>) for direct_sender.send()
- Inline P2pCommand handlers in bridge loop (not separate function) for access to mailbox/direct_sender/retry_queue
- CATCH-01 scoped as push-based recovery via Engine cache re-broadcast on reconnection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Runtime integration (Runner on dedicated thread) is unproven in WAVS context~~ RESOLVED in Plan 01-02: spawn_commonware_runtime() works without nesting panics
- ~~Catch-up guarantee equivalence (buffered Engine is peer-scoped, current protocol is service-scoped)~~ VALIDATED in Plan 02-02: push-based recovery via Engine cache confirmed working in test_catchup_after_reconnect
- Commonware is ALPHA software — pin exact versions, keep types inside p2p module boundary
