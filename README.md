## What is WAVS?

WAVS is a next-generation platform for building and running **Actively Validated Services (AVS)**. It provides a robust infrastructure so you can focus on your service logic, not boilerplate.

**Key Features:**
- Write services in Rust (more languages coming soon)
- Compile to WebAssembly (WASM) for portability and speed
- Deploy as lightweight service components
- Trigger execution from blockchains, clocks, or other events
- Run offchain at near-native speed in the WAVS WASI runtime
- Bring results verifiably onchain
- Dynamically manage multiple components for flexible, intelligent applications

**What is AVS?**
An Actively Validated Service (AVS) is a decentralized service that is validated by independent operators. WAVS makes it easy to create, manage, and operate high-performance AVSs.

**Why WASM?**
WebAssembly (WASM) enables fast, secure, and portable execution of code across platforms. WAVS leverages WASM to run your services efficiently and safely.
