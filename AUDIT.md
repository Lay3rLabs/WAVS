# WAVS Security Audit Report - Practical Assessment

## Executive Summary

This audit focuses on actual security vulnerabilities that could lead to fund loss or system compromise in the WAVS codebase. The assessment assumes this is operator-controlled infrastructure where operators manage their own keys.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Unauthenticated Key Access Endpoint

**Location**: `/packages/wavs/src/http/handlers/service/key.rs:17-34`  
**Endpoint**: `POST /service-key`  
**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Issue**: The endpoint returns signing key information without any authentication checks.

```rust
pub async fn handle_get_service_key(
    State(state): State<HttpState>,
    Json(req): Json<GetServiceKeyRequest>,
) -> impl IntoResponse {
    // No auth check here
    match inner(&state, req.service_manager).await {
        Ok(resp) => Json(resp).into_response(),
        Err(e) => e.into_response(),
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Anyone can query signing key indices and potentially map operator addresses.

**Fix Required**:
- Add authentication middleware (API keys, JWT, or mTLS)
- Implement IP allowlisting for operator access
- Add audit logging for all key access attempts

### 2. Unprotected In-Memory Key Storage

**Location**: `/packages/wavs/src/subsystems/submission.rs:28-29`  
**Severity**: HIGH

**Issue**: Private keys stored in plain HashMap without memory protection.

```rust
evm_signers: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<ServiceId, SignerInfo>>>,
```

**Impact**: Memory dumps or debugging tools could expose private keys.

**Fix Required**:
- Use `zeroize` crate for automatic memory clearing
- Consider `mlock()` to prevent swapping to disk
- Implement key encryption at rest in memory

### 3. Missing Input Validation on External Packet Submission

**Location**: `/packages/aggregator/src/http/handlers/packet.rs:36-100`  
**Endpoint**: `POST /packet`  
**Severity**: HIGH

**Issue**: No rate limiting or packet size validation on external submissions.

**Impact**: 
- DoS through packet flooding
- Memory exhaustion from oversized packets
- Resource starvation

**Fix Required**:
- Add rate limiting per operator address
- Implement maximum packet size limits
- Add request timeout handling
- Validate packet fields before processing

## Important Issues (Should Address)

### 4. No Replay Protection for Packets

**Location**: `/packages/types/src/packet.rs`  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Issue**: Packets don't include nonces or timestamps for replay protection.

**Impact**: Old packets could be replayed if they remain valid.

**Fix Required**:
- Add timestamp field with expiration
- Implement nonce tracking per operator
- Store processed packet hashes temporarily

### 5. Gas Estimation Without Limits

**Location**: `/packages/utils/src/evm_client/signing.rs:51-69`  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Issue**: Gas multiplier applied without upper bound check.

```rust
((gas_estimate as f32) * self.gas_estimate_multiplier()) as u64
```

**Impact**: Excessive gas costs if estimates spike unexpectedly.

**Fix Required**:
- Add configurable maximum gas limit
- Alert on unusual gas spikes
- Implement circuit breaker for anomalous gas costs

## Context-Dependent Concerns (May Be Acceptable)

### Centralized Key Management
- **Current**: Single mnemonic with HD derivation for all services
- **Assessment**: Acceptable for single-operator deployments
- **Consider**: Key rotation mechanism for long-term operations

### Smart Contract Address Validation
- **Current**: Only checks if address has code
- **Assessment**: May be intentional for flexibility
- **Consider**: Optional whitelist mode for production

### Front-Running Risks
- **Current**: Standard transaction submission
- **Assessment**: Normal blockchain behavior
- **Consider**: Private mempools if available on target chains

## Recommended Security Improvements

### Immediate (Before Audit)
1. **Authentication**: Add auth to all management endpoints
2. **Memory Protection**: Implement key zeroization
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protect all external endpoints
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all packet fields

### Short-term (Post-Audit)
1. **Monitoring**: Add anomaly detection for unusual patterns
2. **Key Rotation**: Implement periodic key rotation
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all security-relevant operations
4. **Health Checks**: Add circuit breakers for failing components

### Long-term Considerations
1. **HSM Support**: For high-value deployments
2. **Threshold Signatures**: For multi-operator setups
3. **Formal Verification**: For critical signing paths

## Files Requiring Priority Review

1. `/packages/wavs/src/http/handlers/service/key.rs` - Add authentication
2. `/packages/wavs/src/subsystems/submission.rs` - Protect key storage
3. `/packages/aggregator/src/http/handlers/packet.rs` - Add validation and rate limiting
4. `/packages/utils/src/evm_client/signing.rs` - Add gas limits

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Tests**:
   - Attempt unauthorized key access
   - Test packet replay attacks
   - Verify memory doesn't leak keys
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness

2. **Fuzzing Targets**:
   - Packet parsing logic
   - Signature validation
   - HTTP endpoint inputs

3. **Stress Testing**:
   - High packet submission rates
   - Large packet sizes
   - Concurrent key operations

## Conclusion

The WAVS system has **3 critical issues** that must be fixed before production:
1. Unauthenticated key endpoint
2. Unprotected in-memory keys
3. Missing input validation

These are practical vulnerabilities that external attackers could exploit. The other concerns about "malicious operators" are less relevant since operators control their own infrastructure.

Focus the audit on:
- External attack surfaces (HTTP endpoints)
- Key protection mechanisms
- Input validation and rate limiting
- Replay attack prevention

The centralized key management and other design choices appear intentional for operator-controlled deployments and don't necessarily represent vulnerabilities.
